Introduction
============

The [GoTEE](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/GoTEE) framework implements concurrent instantiation of
[TamaGo](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago) based unikernels in
privileged and unprivileged modes, interacting with each other through monitor
mode and custom system calls

With these capabilities GoTEE implements a [TamaGo](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago)
based Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), bringing Go memory safety,
convenience and capabilities to bare metal execution within TrustZone Secure
World or equivalent isolation technology.

GoTEE can supervise pure Go, Rust or C based freestanding Trusted Applets,
implementing the GoTEE API, as well as any operating system capable of running
in TrustZone Normal World such as Linux.

A compatibility layer for
[libutee](https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/libraries.html#libutee)
is planned, allowing execution of/as [OP-TEE](https://www.op-tee.org/)
compatible applets.

Example application
===================

In TEE nomenclature, the privileged unikernel is commonly referred to as
Trusted OS, while the unprivileged one represents a Trusted Applet.

The GoTEE [example](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/GoTEE-example)
demonstrate concurrent operation of Go unikernels acting as Trusted OS,
Trusted Applet and Main OS.

> :warning: the Main OS can be any "rich" OS (e.g. Linux), TamaGo is simply
> used for a self-contained example. The same applies to the Trusted Applet
> which can be any bare metal application capable of running in user mode and
> implementing GoTEE API, such as freestanding C or Rust programs.
>
> A Rust [example](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/GoTEE-example/tree/master/trusted_applet_rust)
> can be used replacing `trusted_applet_go` with `trusted_applet_rust` when building.

The example trusted OS/applet combination performs basic testing of concurrent
execution of three [TamaGo](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago)
unikernels at different privilege levels:

 * Trusted OS, running in Secure World at privileged level (PL1, system mode)
 * Trusted Applet, running in Secure World at unprivileged level (PL0, user mode)
 * Main OS, running in Normal World at privileged level (PL1, system mode)

The Main OS yields back with a monitor call.

The Trusted Applet sleeps for 5 seconds before attempting to read privileged OS
memory, which triggers an exception handled by the supervisor which terminates
the Trusted Applet.

The GoTEE [syscall](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/GoTEE/blob/master/syscall/syscall.go)
interface is implemented for communication between the Trusted OS and Trusted
Applet.

When launched on the [USB armory Mk II](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki),
the example application is reachable via SSH through
[Ethernet over USB](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki/Host-communication)
(ECM protocol, only supported on Linux hosts):

```
$ ssh gotee@10.0.0.1
PL1 tamago/arm (go1.16.5) • TEE system/monitor (Secure World)

  help                                   # this help
  reboot                                 # reset the SoC/board
  stack                                  # stack trace of current goroutine
  stackall                               # stack trace of all goroutines
  md  <hex offset> <size>                # memory display (use with caution)
  mw  <hex offset> <hex value>           # memory write   (use with caution)

  gotee                                  # TrustZone test w/ TamaGo unikernels
  dbg                                    # show ARM debug permissions
  csl                                    # show config security levels (CSL)
  csl <periph> <slave> <hex csl>         #  set config security level  (CSL)
  sa                                     # show security access (SA)
  sa  <id> <secure|nonsecure>            #  set security access (SA)

>
```

The example can be launched with the `gotee` command, it will spawn the Main OS
twice, to demonstrate behaviour before and after TrustZone restrictions are in
effect in using real hardware peripherals.

Compiling
=========

Build the [TamaGo compiler](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go)
(or use the [latest binary release](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/releases/latest)):

```
wget https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/archive/refs/tags/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
cd tamago-go-latest/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```

Build the example trusted applet and kernel executables:

```
git clone https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/GoTEE-example
cd GoTEE-example && make nonsecure_os_go && make trusted_applet_go && make trusted_os
```

> :warning: replace `trusted_applet_go` with `trusted_applet_rust` for a Rust
> TA example, this requires Rust nightly and the `armv7a-none-eabi` toolchain.

All compilation outputs are written under a `bin` subdirectory.

Executing and debugging
=======================

Native hardware
---------------

The PoC can be executed on the [USB armory Mk II](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki)
by loading the compilation output `bin/trusted_os.imx` in
[SDP mode](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki/Boot-Modes-(Mk-II)#serial-download-protocol-sdp).
